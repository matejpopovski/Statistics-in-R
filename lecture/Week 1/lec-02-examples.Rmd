## Learning Outcomes

* This lecture will teach you how to:
    + Create and work with simple variables
    + Use basic functions and their arguments, and access their help files
    + Create and work with simple vectors
    + Create and work with simple dataframes

## Variables

> Variables are a named object which "contains" some value, vector, dataframe, or other information.

* You can create a new variable with the expression `newVariableName = ...`, where `...` is the information you want the variable to store.
    + Some will use `<-` instead of `=`; they are exactly the same.

* You use the same code to edit the information stored in a variable that already exists.

* You can see all the variables you have created and their values by checking your `Environment`; use `View > Show Environment` if you cannot find it.

```{r}
myFavoriteNumber = 12
```

* Notice: This chunk does not print anything; the expression was stored within a variable.

* Now, in expressions which use `myFavoriteNumber`, 12 will be substituted wherever you put that name.

```{r}
myFavoriteNumber + 2
```

* Notice that last code chunk does NOT have the `newVariableName = ...` form. The expression evaluates to 14, but this is not captured anywhere, so it just becomes output. The value of `myFavoriteNumber` is still 12.

### Variable Names

* Variable names can be made up of lower case letters, `a-z`, upper case letters `A-Z`, digits `0-9`, and the symbols period `.` and under score `_`.
    + R is case sensitive, so the names `a` and `A` are different.
    + A valid name cannot begin with a number.
    + As the period has special meaning in some contexts, I tend to avoid its use.
    + A name which begins with a `.` is also good to avoid as these are conventionally reserved for special system variables and are hidden in the environment.
    
```{r, error = TRUE}
## trying to use an illegal name causes an error
1a = 10
```

```{r}
## a legal assignment, but the variable does not appear in the environment
.a = 10

## Use the function ls() to list all objects
## Note .a is not included
ls()

## Add an argument to show the hidden variables too
ls(all.names = TRUE)
```

## Operators

> Operators are basic symbols like `+` and `>` which represent simple mathematical or logical actions.

* The mathematical operators take two numerical objects and output the numerical result.

```{r}
# The simple math operators; addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
myFavoriteNumber + 2
myFavoriteNumber - 2
myFavoriteNumber * 2
myFavoriteNumber / 2

# Two different ways to compute myFavoriteNumber to the power of 2
myFavoriteNumber**2
myFavoriteNumber^2
```

* The logical operators take two numerical objects, compare them, and return `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

```{r}
# Greater than
myFavoriteNumber > 10
myFavoriteNumber > 12

# Greater than OR equal to
myFavoriteNumber >= 10
myFavoriteNumber >= 12

# Less than
myFavoriteNumber < 10
myFavoriteNumber < 12

# Less than OR equal to
myFavoriteNumber <= 10
myFavoriteNumber < 10
```

* A logical operator which requires special care is the double equals `==`, to check if two numerical objects have the same value.
    + `!=` is used for "NOT equal to".

* It is not `=`, because that is reserved for variable creation/value assignment as above.

```{r}
# Check for equality, the correct way
myFavoriteNumber == 12
myFavoriteNumber == 13

# Check for inequality
myFavoriteNumber != 12
myFavoriteNumber != 13
```

```{r}
# The incorrect way to check if myFavoriteNumber is 13. This is replacing its value with 13, not checking if it is equal. Notice that it did not print a TRUE or FALSE; a bad sign if you were checking for equality!
myFavoriteNumber = 13

# It's not 12 anymore!
myFavoriteNumber 
```


## Functions

> Functions are a set of instructions, which require the user to give some input*, and then give you back something.

*Note: Most, but not all functions require you to give input. For example, `getwd()` requires no input.*

* You can create your own functions in R, but this is outside the scope of the course; all functions will be provided to you in this course, your objective is to use them.

* Functions take the form `functionName(argument1, argument2, ...)`

```{r}
# For example: the "square root" function returns the square root of the number you give it.
sqrt(9)
```

* The inputs you give to a function are called *arguments*, and it is important you give the right type, and amount.

* If you don't, you'll get an error message which might be helpful (see below), or might not be in more complex cases. 

```{r, error = TRUE}
sqrt()
sqrt(9, 10)
sqrt("banana")
```

* If you don't capture the result of a function, its result will be printed out. However, you can capture the result in a variable name using the form we saw in the above section.

```{r}
firstTenSum = sum(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10) # Calculate and store the value
firstTenSum # Print it out
```

* Very often, arguments will have helpful names, which you can optionally use.
    + Using the names of the arguments prevents you from having to memorize their order and helps you understand exactly what is going on.
    
* Furthermore, many arguments have default values; values they will take on if you don't tell the function what they should be.
    + These values are often what you would expect and want them to be.

* We are about to see an example of these more complicated arguments in the Vectors section - hold tight.

* The names and order of arguments can be found on their help page.

### Accessing the Help Page

* Every R function has an associated help page which tells you what it does, and the order and names of its arguments.
    + They are written rather technically, but with practice you will learn to extract the helpful information you need from them.
    + Very often, the bottom of the help page will have examples of varying complexity.
    
> Type `?functionName` in the console to bring up the help page for that function.

* Practice typing `?seq` in the console, which will bring up the help page for the basic sequence generation function, which we are about to use.

## Vectors

> A vector is a ordered sequence of objects.

* Our primary interest in this course is dataframes - more complex tables of rows and columns.
    + These dataframes are comprised of vectors (each column is a vector)
    + Vectors are also often useful on their own.

* The main, manual way to create a vector is using the `c()` function, standing for "combine", which takes the objects you list and combining them into one vector.

```{r}
myFavoriteFoods = c("apple pie", "mac and peas", "short rib")
primeNumbers = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11)

# Notice how these variables are storing the entire sequence.
myFavoriteFoods
primeNumbers
```

* You can access individual elements within a vector with `vectorName[#]`, where `#` is a number or vector of numbers representing the numeric position(s) within the vector (*starting at 1*) of the element(s) you want to extract. We will rarely do this in this class. 

```{r}
myFavoriteFoods[2]
primeNumbers[c(4, 5)] # Note that these are POSITIONS within the vector, not the actual elements "4" and "5"
```

* Shortcuts exist for common cases of creating a numeric vector.

### Numeric Sequences

* When creating a numeric sequence, the `seq` function is a shortcut to not have to type out every single number you want.

* Its main arguments (still have that help page up from earlier?) are `from`, `to`, and `by`, in that order.

```{r}
# From 0, to 10, by 2
seq(0, 10, 2)
```

#### Detour: Named and Default Arguments

* I promised you we'd get back to this!

* Named arguments are helpful because they allow you to use a function without memorizing its argument order, or in the case where a function has many arguments, it allows you to only specify the ones you want.

```{r}
# Don't want to memorize the order? Use their names, which will override the order!
seq(to = 10, by = 2, from = 0) # Notice these aren't in the order provided
```

* Default arguments tell the function what value an argument should take if the user does not say. Not all arguments have a default value.

```{r}
# In the help file, the default for "from" is 1. This is what it will be if we don't tell seq() what 'from' should be. 
seq(by = 50, to = 101)
```

### Back to Numeric Sequences

* An even *shorter* shortcut exists for the common case where you want "by" to be 1.

* The code `x:y`, where `x` and `y` are two numbers, will generate a sequence from `x` to `y` incrementing by 1's.
    + It may not look like it, but this is calling `seq()` with by = 1 behind the scenes.
    + This saves the impatient programmer up to TEN keystrokes! Even more free time to spend learning more R!

```{r}
# The [1] in the output indicates that the following number (0) is the first in the sequence. Any new lines the sequence stretches to will also have this helpful counter.
0:50

15:myFavoriteNumber # Extended use: backward sequences, and variable use. Remember how we changed myFavoriteNumber to 13 in the Variables section?
```

### Vector Arithmetic

* In many computer languages, you need loops to work over vectors (or arrays) of value
* In R, most of the language is *vectorized*, so you do not need explicit loops.
    + Many students who have Java or Python backgrounds instinctively write `for` loops in R.
    + We highly discourage this: you can make your life SO much easier by just using the vectorized functions.
    
* Any vector-on-vector operation will be done to the first element of each, then the second element of each, and so on.

```{r}
## two small example vectors
oneTwoThree = 1:3
fourFiveSix = 4:6

## addition by element
oneTwoThree + fourFiveSix

## subtraction by element
fourFiveSix - oneTwoThree

## multiplication by element
oneTwoThree*fourFiveSix
```

* Logical operators also work element-wise when using vectors.

```{r}
oneTwoThree >= 2
```

* It is also common to do operations between a single number and a vector of numbers.
    + Effectively, the single number is replicated to be the same length as the vector and then the operations occur.

```{r}
## addition
oneTwoThree + 5

## subtraction
oneTwoThree - 5
```

#### Incompatible sizes

* R allows vector arithmetic with incompatibly-sized vectors
* The shorter vector is replicated to be the same length as the longer one.
* If it does not work evenly, then a warning is produced.

```{r}
fourFive = 4:5

## Adding c(1,2,3) and c(4,5); one is longer, so shorter one is duplicated until it is long enough
## fourFive is changed to c(4,5,4), but the last repeat of 4,5 is stopped short
## a warning is given as this was likely an error
oneTwoThree + fourFive
```

### Common Vector Functions

* It is important to understand if a function is going to return a vector or a single number back. For example, these functions return a vector back, with an operation done on each element individually.

```{r}
## exp()
exp(oneTwoThree)

## natural log, log()
log(oneTwoThree)

## log base 10
log(oneTwoThree, base = 10)
```

* Other functions summarize a vector of numbers into a single value

```{r}
a = seq(7, 42, by = 7)

## sum
sum(a)

## mean
mean(a)

## standard deviation
## if you have had a stats course before....
sd(a)

## length
length(a)

## maximum
max(a)

## minimum
min(a)

## median
median(a)
```

##### EXERCISE: Put It All Together

* Find the sum of all the odd numbers between 1 and 99.

```{r}
# Live Coding
```

## Dataframes

> Dataframes are tables of data, represented in a grid of rows and columns. Real data very often is stored in a table like this.

* We will teach you how to get information from an external data file into a variable in R.
* We can also construct dataframes by hand using `data.frame(columnName1 = vector1, columnName2 = vector2...)`.
    + In this class, we will use the tidyverse version of a dataframe, a `tibble`, which is exactly the same but more convenient and optimized in subtle, behind-the-scenes ways. Instead of `data.frame(...)` above, use `tibble(...)`.

```{r}
# "letters" is a built in R vector with the 26 lowercase letters
letters

# This will create a dataframe of two columns, with the names char and pos, and ten rows. Notice we are creating the dataframe by inputting COLUMNS.
# Use "tibble" instead of data.frame
myData = tibble(char = letters[1:10], pos = 1:10)
myData
```

* Like vectors, we can navigate into dataframes manually, but we will almost never ask you to do this.

* If you want the single entry at row number `r` and column number `c`, you can obtain it with `dataFrameName[r, c]`.

```{r}
# Seventh row, first column
myData[7, 1]
```

* Recall that dataframes are just composed of vectors. If you leave the row number or column number blank in the above example, it will return ALL rows or columns, respectively.

```{r}
# Column was left blank; return all (both) columns, ninth row only
myData[9, ]

# Row was left blank; return all rows, second column only
myData[ , 2]
```

* If you want to extract a column as a vector, rather than a one-column dataframe, use the `$` operator as shown below.

```{r}
# Compare this output with the above output; notice how they are displayed differently, illustrating that they are different type objects.
myData$pos
```

##### EXERCISE: Familiarizing Yourself With A Dataframe

* The example dataframe above was relatively small. Let's practice exploring a more intense dataframe with information about when Lake Mendota froze over for the last 168 years.
  + *Make sure you have run library(tidyverse) at the top of this file first, or it will say function `read_csv` not found.*

* Run the following chunk, which takes the data in the `.csv` file and reads it into an R object called `mendota`. You should see it appear in your environment.

```{r}
mendota = read_csv("../../data/lake-mendota-winters-2023.csv")
```

* Run `View(mendota)` in your console. This will bring up a separate window with the whole dataframe.

* Run `head(mendota)` in your console. This should print the first 6 rows of the dataframe.

* Run `glimpse(mendota)` in your console.

* Reflect; which of the above three commands do you like best for familiarizing yourself with the `mendota` dataframe? This is a matter of personal opinion.

* Run `colnames(mendota)` in your console.

* Run `dim(mendota)` in your console. `dim` here stands for "dimensions", giving you the number of rows and columns in the dataframe. It returns a *vector* with length 2.

* Run `nrow(mendota)` and `ncol(mendota)` in your console; they are the same numbers from `dim`, but as single numbers.
